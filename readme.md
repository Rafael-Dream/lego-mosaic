# Purpose
This project started with a common question, where can I find a gift for my wife? <br/>
We love Lego, and I'm really impressive by Beatles and Elvis set. <br/>
So here is an Idea, whatif I can make a program which can input photo, output a instruction, then follow the instruction to build our own Lego mosaic picture. <br/>
Sounds amazing and fun! <br/>
I still have some time before Christmas, let's do this! <br/>
